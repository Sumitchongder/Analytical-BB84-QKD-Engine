## Contribution Guidelines

* Follow clean, modular Python coding practices
* Add docstrings and inline comments where appropriate
* Keep changes focused and well-scoped
* Ensure analytical and simulation results remain consistent
* Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies
* Maintain reproducibility (fixed seeds, deterministic logic where possible)

---

## Scientific Integrity

When contributing:

* Clearly state assumptions and approximations
* Distinguish between simulation and analytical results
* Cite relevant prior work if introducing new methods
* Avoid overstating claims beyond what results support

---

## Review Process

Pull requests are evaluated based on:

* Technical correctness
* Code clarity and maintainability
* Scientific validity
* Alignment with project goals
* Educational and research value
