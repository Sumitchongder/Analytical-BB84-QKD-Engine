## 📖 Overview

This project presents a complete, interactive implementation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol using **Qiskit** and **Streamlit**. It demonstrates how two parties (Alice and Bob) can securely generate a shared key while detecting any eavesdropping attempts by Eve. The system features a dual-backend architecture:

- **Simulator Mode** using Qiskit Aer for correctness validation  
- **Analytical Turbo Mode** enables scalable, real-time visualization of Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) by replacing gate-level quantum simulation with closed-form probabilistic models that compute ensemble-averaged outcomes across thousands of qubits, eliminating the need for per-qubit gate and measurement simulation.

Users can toggle between multiple Eve strategies
- **DoNothing:** Eve remains passive and does not interfere with the qubits, resulting in no disturbance.
- **Intercept-Resend:** Eve measures each qubit in a fixed basis and resends it, causing significant errors when her basis mismatches Alice’s.
- **Probabilistic Skew:** Eve chooses her measurement basis with a biased probability, introducing subtle errors that are harder to detect.
  
Our app also offers a **stepwise walkthrough** of the **BB84 protocol**, allowing users to observe each phase of quantum key generation and security validation in detail.

Our app includes **strategy-aware dashboards**, **annotated heatmaps**, and **secure/abort zone visualizations** — making quantum security fast, clear, and interactive.

## 🧠 Why BB84?

As quantum computers advance, classical encryption methods like RSA and ECC face potential compromise. BB84 offers a physics-based alternative: any attempt to intercept qubits introduces detectable errors. This project makes BB84 tangible through simulation, visualization, and analysis.

### 🔐 BB84 Protocol — 6 Key Steps
- **Alice generates random bits and bases:** 
She creates a sequence of 0s and 1s, and randomly chooses a basis (Z or X) to encode each bit as a quantum state.
- **Alice sends qubits to Bob:**
Each bit is encoded as a qubit — either |0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, or |−⟩ and transmitted over a quantum channel.
- **Bob measures each qubit in a random basis:**
Bob doesn’t know Alice’s basis, so he randomly picks Z or X for each qubit and records the result.

- **Alice and Bob share their basis choices:**
Over a public classical channel, they reveal which basis they used — but not the actual bit values.

- **Sifting and QBER estimation:**
They keep only the bits where their bases matched (sifted key), then compare a small sample to estimate the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER).

- **Error Correction and Privacy Amplification:**
If QBER is low, they correct errors and compress the key to remove any leaked information, resulting in a secure shared key.

##### 🖼️ “Quantum circuit representation of BB84: Alice prepares qubits, Eve intercepts (Intercept Resend Attack), Bob measures”

- Intercept-Resend Attack: Eve secretly measures each qubit in a fixed basis (usually Z), then sends a new qubit to Bob — introducing noticeable errors if her basis doesn’t match Alice’s.

##### 🖼️ “Quantum circuit representation of BB84: Alice prepares qubits, Eve intercepts (Probabilistic Skew Attack), Bob measures”

- Probabilistic Skew Attack: Eve randomly chooses her measurement basis with a bias (e.g., 70% Z, 30% X), making her interference harder to detect but still causing subtle errors.

## 📈 Results

### Error Checking: QBER + Decoy Yields

- We perform error checking by estimating QBER from sifted bits and validating decoy state yields to ensure channel integrity and detect eavesdropping. 
- The Expected Order should be: Signal > Decoy > Vacuum. Deviations can indicate eavesdropping or channel anomalies. Additionally, the QBER value should be less than the Abort threshold (QBER) value; otherwise, QBER aborts.

## 💡 Innovation

- **Turbo Mode:** Analytical backend with vectorized probability model  
- **Strategy-Aware Dashboards:** Compare Eve strategies side-by-side  
- **Secure/Abort Zone Visualization:** Cyan contours + region labels  

  
### 1. Error Correction + Privacy Amplification (Using Vectorized QKD Simulation)  

<img width="1167" height="654" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6af31263-6d4b-4ad0-995a-42643911b0d4" />

- ✅ Threshold-based modelling: We simulate EC and PA using a configurable QBER threshold (e.g., 11%) to decide whether the protocol proceeds or aborts.
- 🧮 Error Correction (EC): If QBER is below the threshold, we assume classical error correction succeeds and mismatched bits are reconciled.
- 🔐 Privacy Amplification (PA): We reduce the final key length based on estimated information leakage.
- ⚡ Vectorized simulation: This approach avoids slow bit-level operations and enables fast, scalable analysis across many parameter settings.
- 📊 Real-time feedback: Users instantly see whether EC/PA succeeds and how much usable key material remains.
